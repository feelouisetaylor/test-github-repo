## About Me

I have done markdown before on GitLab, I think I remember most of it, but lets hope
- I can't fully remember how to do images (!image) something like that
- I can remember tables
- I can remember bullets and 'to highlight'
- I can remember to make ~~bold~~ *italics*
- I think **bold** is 2 *

- [X] tick boxes
- [ ] yay
